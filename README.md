# DevPool

A faster way to apply to more jobs!

A tinder like application to find the job best for you! Swipe left to skip, swipe right to apply instantly.

For now, we will be focusing on just development jobs, hints the name, "DevPool".

## MVP

Authenticate with indeed (or other job search applications) to supply jobs, that are actively looking for recruitment, to the user.

Once the jobs are supplied, allow the user to skip through them or instantly apply with the click of a button (or swipe of a finger!).

**If** we cannot authenticate with a job searching engine with ease, then we will need to build a database of jobs searching for employees. *Perhaps by some sort of web scraping*.

*We will be utilizing VueJS as our new tech.*
